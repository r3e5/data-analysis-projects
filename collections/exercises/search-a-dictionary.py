## Set a variable called choice to the flavor you want to search for.

## If it is, set another variable called cost to the value associated with choice.

### Search a Dictionary Part 2:

## Initialize two variables: highest_cost to 0 and fanciest to an empty string.
highest_cost = 0
fanciest = ''
## Loop through the flavors dictionary using a for loop.
for flavor in flavors:
## For each flavor, check if its price is higher than highest_cost.
  if flavors[flavor] > highest_cost:
## If it is, update fanciest to this flavor and highest_cost to its price.
    highest_cost = flavors[flavor]
    fanciest = flavor
## After the loop, print the most expensive flavor.
print('The fanciest flavor is',fanciest,'it costs',highest_cost,'per scoop!')
